Follow these steps to run **WeDraw** locally on your machine:

### 1. ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or above recommended, as per `@types/node:^20`)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning the repository)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2. üìÇ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukmaann/wedraw.git
cd wedraw
```

### 3. üì¶ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`, including Next.js, Liveblocks, Clerk, Convex, and UI libraries.

### 4. üîë Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the required environment variables for Clerk, Liveblocks, and Convex. Example:

```env
# Deployment used by `npx convex dev`
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/createroom
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/createroom
```

Obtain these keys from:
- [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/)
- [Liveblocks Dashboard](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)
- [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)

### 5. üöÄ Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the app at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to use WeDraw.

### 6. üõ†Ô∏è Build for Production

To create a production build and start the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 7. ‚úÖ Lint the Code

Check for code quality issues using ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript for type safety. Ensure your editor supports TypeScript for the best development experience.
- **ESLint**: Configured with `eslint-config-next` for Next.js-specific linting rules.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styles are managed with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS. Customize styles in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Liveblocks**: Ensure you have a Liveblocks account and valid API keys for real-time collaboration.
- **Clerk**: Authentication requires Clerk API keys. Set up Clerk for user management.
- **Convex**: The backend uses Convex for data storage. Configure your Convex project and deploy the schema.
